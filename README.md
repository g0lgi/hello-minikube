## 1. Compare the application logs before and after you exposed it as a Service. Try to open the app several times while the proxy into the Service is running. What do you see in the logs? Does the number of logs increase each time you open the app?
After exposing the application as a Service, the logs show an increase in the number of requests each time the app is accessed. This indicates that the Service is successfully routing external traffic to the Pod.
## 2. Notice that there are two versions of `kubectl get` invocation during this tutorial section. The first does not have any option, while the latter has `-n` option with value set to `kube-system`. What is the purpose of the `-n` option and why did the output not list the pods/services that you explicitly created?
The -n option specifies the namespace to use for the kubectl command. The output did not list the pods/services created in the default namespace because the -n kube-system option was used, which lists resources in the kube-system namespace, reserved for internal Kubernetes operations.
